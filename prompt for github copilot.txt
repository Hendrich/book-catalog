Read and analzye the PRD document and help me create an implementaion checklist. The code architecture must be modular and easy to test. For each UI elements, always consider to create a component. Enable hot reload for easy testing, always show the clear error on implemention to allow AI can test and debug easily. Also add unit testing for each component, and E2E testing for each user workflow.
